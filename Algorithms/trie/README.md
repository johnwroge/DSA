# Trie Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of specialized trie (prefix tree) data structures: **Autocomplete Trie**, **Dictionary Trie**, **Word Search Trie**, and advanced variations for different use cases.

## What are Tries?

A **Trie** (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Each node represents a single character, and paths from root to leaves represent complete words.

### Key Properties:
- **Prefix-based**: All descendants of a node share a common prefix
- **Space-time tradeoff**: Fast lookups at the cost of memory usage
- **Insertion/Search**: O(m) where m = string length
- **Prefix operations**: Extremely efficient for prefix-based queries

## Core Applications

| Domain | Use Case | Primary Benefit |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Text Processing** | Autocomplete, spell check | Fast prefix matching |
| **Search Engines** | Query suggestions, indexing | Efficient text retrieval |
| **Networking** | IP routing, DNS lookup | Hierarchical address resolution |
| **Bioinformatics** | DNA sequence analysis | Pattern matching in genomes |
| **Compilers** | Symbol tables, keyword recognition | Fast identifier lookup |

## Algorithm Comparison

| Trie Type | Primary Use | Space Complexity | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Autocomplete** | Real-time suggestions | O(ALPHABET_SIZE × N × M) | User interfaces, search bars |
| **Dictionary** | Word validation, lookup | O(ALPHABET_SIZE × N × M) | Spell checkers, language tools |
| **Word Search** | 2D grid pattern matching | O(ALPHABET_SIZE × N × M) | Puzzle games, text analysis |
| **Compressed** | Memory optimization | O(E) where E = edges | Large dictionaries, mobile apps |

### 🚀 Time Complexity Comparison

| Operation | Autocomplete | Dictionary | Word Search | Hash Set |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Insert** | O(m) | O(m) | O(m) | O(m) |
| **Search** | O(m) | O(m) | O(m) | O(1) avg |

### 💾 Space Complexity Analysis

#### Standard Trie
- **Worst case**: O(ALPHABET_SIZE^h × n) where h = max depth
- **Average case**: O(total_characters × branching_factor)
- **Optimization**: Path compression reduces space significantly

#### Memory Usage by Type
```python
# Typical memory per node
Standard Trie Node: ~200-400 bytes
Compressed Trie Node: ~100-200 bytes
Hash Set Entry: ~50-100 bytes

# For 100k English words
Standard Trie: ~50-100 MB
Compressed Trie: ~20-40 MB  
Hash Set: ~5-10 MB
```

### ⚡ Performance Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Path Compression
```python
# Instead of storing single characters
# Store compressed paths for linear chains
node.edge_label = "ing"  # Compressed suffix
```

#### 2. Frequency Caching
```python
# Cache popular suggestions at prefix nodes
node.cached_suggestions = ["apple", "application", "apply"]
```

#### 3. Lazy Loading
```python
# Load trie sections on demand
def get_subtrie(self, prefix):
    if prefix not in self.loaded_subtries:
        self.loaded_subtries[prefix] = self.load_from_disk(prefix)
```

#### 4. Memory Pooling
```python
# Reuse node objects to reduce allocation overhead
node_pool = NodePool(initial_size=10000)
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 🧠 Sophisticated Applications

#### 1. Fuzzy Matching Trie
```python
class FuzzyTrie:
    def fuzzy_search(self, query, max_edits=2):
        # Return words within edit distance
        
    def phonetic_search(self, soundex_code):
        # Search by phonetic similarity
```

#### 2. Persistent Trie
```python
class PersistentTrie:
    def insert_version(self, word, version):
        # Maintain multiple trie versions
        
    def query_version(self, prefix, version):
        # Query specific version
```

#### 3. Concurrent Trie
```python
class ConcurrentTrie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locks = {}  # Fine-grained locking
        
    def thread_safe_insert(self, word):
        # Support concurrent modifications
```

#### 4. Radix Trie (Compressed)
```python
class RadixTrie:
    def insert(self, word):
        # Compress linear chains of nodes
        
    def search(self, word):
        # Navigate compressed paths
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### ⚠️ Frequent Mistakes

1. **Memory explosion**: Not considering alphabet size impact
2. **Poor cache locality**: Random access patterns
3. **Inefficient serialization**: Slow loading/saving
4. **Thread safety issues**: Race conditions in concurrent access
5. **Incorrect deletion**: Leaving orphaned nodes

### 💡 Best Practices

#### Code Organization
```python
# Separate concerns clearly
class TrieNode:     # Core data structure
class TrieOps:      # Operations (insert, search, delete)
